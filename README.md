# Building the basic structure 
### The objective is to build the basic structure to begin a full cycle development with the following steps:
+ Adding React
- Adding Sass
+ Transforming the Web Application into a PWA
- Add a API with simple routes
+ Work in a DevOps environment with Docker

> It is still under construction with the next steps being add a Travis file, and later choose between GCP or AWS to create the complete CI/CD pipeline.
